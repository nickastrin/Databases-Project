# Hotel Database

## Overview

This project was created for the Databases Course @ NTUA ECE, 2021. The purpose of this project was firstly to create and populate a relational database. Then, we had to connect it to a backend and a frontend, through which a user could find places in the hotel where a person infected with COVID19 has been. A user could also find the people in the hotel that have been in contact with an infected person and therefore have to be quarantined as well as various statistics and information.
